# Diving into the unknown

4/12/20
Hello!! This is my personal website that I am undertaking because learning new stuff and building is fun!! Normally to satisfy my creative/building urges, I take to the Makerspace at my University, but since we're in quarantine, I'll just have to build online :P We're off to a rocky start right now because I have literally no HTML or CSS experience, but I'm in it for the adventure! Let's see where it takes us :)
