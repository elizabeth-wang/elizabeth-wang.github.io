I'm finally got around to making my own website with code and all that shazam. I'm following a tutorial right now and I can tell if I wanna get this website to showcase myself, it's gonna need a lot of work (and self discovery). It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) -- whatever that means -- and I can use Markdown for this plain text. Thank god Markdown is easy... and that Reddit has taught me it.
